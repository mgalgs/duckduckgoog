# DuckDuckGoog

This is a Firefox addon to put g! on a keyboard shortcut for quicker DDG
ripcord pulling.

Using DuckDuckGo is an ethical imperative nowadays, but occasionally the
results are lacking compared to Google Search. This extension makes it
easier to set DDG as your default search engine by making it extremely
quick and easy to move your search to Google. Just hit Control-Comma from
the DDG search results page and - WHAM - you're Goog to go.
