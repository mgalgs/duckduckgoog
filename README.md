# DuckDuckGoog

This is a Firefox addon to put g! on a keyboard shortcut for quicker
ripcord pulling. Currently supports DuckDuckGo and Brave Search.

Using non-Google search is an ethical imperative nowadays, but occasionally
the results are lacking compared to Google Search. This extension reduces
friction in setting DDG or Brave as your default search engine by making it
extremely quick and easy to move your search to Google. Just hit
Control-Comma from the search results page and - WHAM - you're Goog to go.
